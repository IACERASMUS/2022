# Registration

Registration is free.

The school will operate in a hybrid format with in-person participation capped at approximately 20 attendees.  When registering please state your preference for in-person or remote (via zoom) attendance.  We also request a brief statement highlighting your motivation for joining the school in case of over-subscription for in-person participation.

Those requesting in-person attendance will be informed whether they have been accepted within two weeks of the deadline.

## [Registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaVcu1drZViepYn_UZ1cHutmKqg0OJNNnxt_yAsP8-JnXuLg/viewform) * Deadline for consideration for in-person attendance June 15th 2022 *

## Requirements

The school will include both traditional lectures and more hands-on tutorials.  These tutorials will primarily be delivered in the form of jupyter notebooks, as such attendees should have access to a linux/mac computer with a working installation of python3+.  Jupyter will be useful, but the commands can be copy-pasted into a python prompt.  Participants will be informed of the required packages before the school, but it is safe to assume that they will include: astropy, matplotlib, numpy, phoebe, scipy, and their dependencies.

## Lunches and excursion

Lunches for the duration of the school will also be provided free for the in-person attendees.

An excursion to the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory will be organised for one afternoon of the school and will be free for all in-person attendees.

## No financial support for travel or accommodation is available
