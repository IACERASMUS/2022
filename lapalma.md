# La Palma

## Travel

La Palma is the northwesternmost island of the Canarian archiepelago.  Daily direct flights from the Spanish capital, Madrid, run with Iberia.  There are roughly weekly connections is several other major [European cities](https://www.aena.es/en/la-palma/airlines-and-destinations/airport-destinations.html), including London, Berlin, Munich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Zurich.

## Weather

In September, La Palma is generally warm and clear, with temperatures ranging from 20-30C.  However, due to its sub-tropical island climate, heavy rains and/or storms are not unheard of.  At the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, the temperature can be significantly lower even in the Summer months.  So, those attendees wishing to join for the observatory visit should come prepared with appropriate clothes (and footwear).
