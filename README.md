# [Registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaVcu1drZViepYn_UZ1cHutmKqg0OJNNnxt_yAsP8-JnXuLg/viewform) * Deadline June 15th 2022 *
### September 26-30 2022 at the Centre for Astrophysics on La Palma, Cuesta de San Jos√©, La Palma, Spain

With numerous active or recently completed public, space-based missions and ground-based follow-up surveys, never before has such a wealth of high-quality and homogeneous multi-epoch photometry and spectroscopy been available -- making this truly the golden age of time-domain astronomy.  These data offer the opportunity to derive fundamental stellar parameters with a precision that was previously impossible.  In particular, time-resolved light and radial velocity curves of eclipsing binary stars are critical tools with which to derive model-independent masses and radii, while asteroseismology of pulsating stars can be used derive their hitherto hidden internal structure.

In this school, we will outline the fundamentals of the determination of stellar parameters, as well as providing an introduction to both the publicly available data and the cutting-edge tools and software used in their exploitation.  The school itself will be divided into more traditional lectures and hands-on sessions/tutorials demonstrating, for example, the access to survey data and its modelling with state-of-the-art tools.

The school will operate in a hybrid format. In-person attendance is limited to 10 students, while a further 50 participants will join via zoom.  Support for remote attendees will be provided via a dedicated slack channel.
